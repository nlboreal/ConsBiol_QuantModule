## Quantitative Methods Overview

Biology, including ecology and conservation, is becoming increasingly quantitative. Familiarity with a range of statistical tools (frequentist, multivariate, Bayesian) is expected. Many researchers draw on quantitative methods; whether it is process or mathematical modelling, programming, bioinformatics, or bioeconomic analyses. We will only touch on key concepts in quantitative methods; in-depth training would require multiple full-semester courses. Here, we will carry out a few simple exercise that mimics some of the quantitative skills that you need to be a successful ecologist. These are:

1.	Use R!
2.	Manage data sets
3.	Plot data
4.	Fit a model to data

In this module there will be a small assignment with each of the above objectives. These are detailed below along with the percentage of your final grade that this is worth (the entire module is worth 10% of your final mark).
